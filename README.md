## Quick summary

- Purpose: accelerate and simplify export-import workflows for MSMEs using document intelligence, compliance checks, tracking and analytics.
- Contents: frontend (client/), backend (server/), and AI microservices (ai-services/).

---

## Key features

- OCR + NLP based document extraction and validation
- Compliance & rules validation for shipping and export processes
- Predictive analytics and route optimization
- Responsive, PWA-capable frontend
- Extensible microservice design for ML models

---

## Tech stack

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Prisma (Postgres)
- AI: Python, FastAPI, (TensorFlow/PyTorch/OpenCV as needed)
- Infra: Docker, Redis, Postgres

---

## Quick start

1. Clone repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/TanmayPatil28/senvia-niryat-ai.git
    cd senvia-niryat-ai
```

2. (Optional) Install all packages and run both services using root helper scripts (if present):

```powershell
npm run install:all   # may install client/server deps if the script exists
npm run dev           # concurrently starts server + client if configured
```

If root scripts are not present or you prefer manual control, run services individually as below.

---

## Run services individually

Frontend (Vite)

```powershell
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Backend (Express)

```powershell
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

AI services (Python)

```powershell
cd ai-services
python -m venv .venv
. .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1   # Windows PowerShell
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Default dev ports (may vary if in use):

- Frontend: 3000-3003 (Vite may pick an available port)
- Backend API: 7000
- AI services: 8000

---

## Environment (examples)

Create a `.env` file in `server/` with the minimum required keys:

```dotenv
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname"
PORT=7000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

Optionally for the client (create `client/.env`):

```dotenv
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:7000
```

---

└── README.md        # this file
```

---

## Development notes

- If a port is already in use, Vite will pick a different port; check the terminal output for the exact URL.
- The backend may fail to start if port 7000 is taken. Free the port or change `PORT` in the server `.env`.
- Use Git feature branches and open PRs against `main`.
